# Hackathon Submitter App

The Hackathon Submitter GitHub App is used to manage private submissions for the SBI Hackathon. All GitHub repositories that are used to submit ideas/source code for the hackathon need to have the Hackathon Submitter GitHub App installed.

Read the [Install](#install) section on how to Install the GitHub App for the first time on your account. 

If you have already installed the app and wanted to include more repositories for your submissions (ex: if you have multiple ideas that you want to submit), read the [Configure](#configure) section

1. Go to the [Hackathon Submitter App homepage on GitHub](https://github.com/apps/hackathon-submitter).
