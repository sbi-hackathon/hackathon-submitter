# FAQs

### Can I rename the folders in my submission repository?

Please, no! You will see two main folders within this repository called `idea` and `source`. These folders will hold your idea and source code submission respectively for the hackathon. Please don't rename these two folders in any way, since this could lead to your submission failing. 

### Can I add/change folders within the `idea` and `source` folders?

Yes! Feel free to structure these any way you like, as long as the main top-level folders of `idea` and `source` are not changed. 

### What title do I add for my GitHub Issues while submitting?

Anything! You can name the GitHub Issue anything you want, as long as your GitHub Issue has the `idea` and `submit-idea` labels for Idea submission and `source` and `submit-source` labels for your prototype/source code submission. 

### Can I close the Issue after I make the idea/source code submission?

No! Please keep the Issue open. Once your submission has been successful, the Hackathon Submitter app will close the Issue for you automatically.

#### Can I upload a zip/compressed file of my source code within the `source` folder?

No. Your source code should be uploaded as-it-is without any compression and should be viewable from within GitHub.
